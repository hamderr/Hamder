3. Declare 3 arrays arrX, arrY, prodXY each containing 10 elements of type int. Do a compile- time initialization for arrays arrX and arrY only (use 10 different values for each), eg:  [0] [1] [2] [3] ... ... [9] arrX 3 5 -1 0 -10 ... ... ... ... 8 arrY 0 2 4 6 -1 ... ... ... ... 2 prodXY (a) Write the program code to store the product of the corresponding elements of the two arrays arrX and arrY into the third array prodXY. Then display the name and contents of all three arrays one by one (horizontally). [You will need 1 loop for the processing, and 3 loops to display the 3 arrays.] (b) Modify the code in Q3(a) so that the contents of all the three arrays are displayed vertically below their names. [Use 1 loop to display all 3 arrays.]
